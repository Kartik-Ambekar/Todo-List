Description:

This Todo-List web application allows users to manage their tasks by providing an interface to add new tasks along with their due dates and delete existing tasks. The application's structure is divided into three main files:

HTML (index.html): Defines the layout and structure of the web page, including input fields for task names and due dates, as well as buttons to add tasks and display existing tasks.

CSS (styles.css): Contains the styling rules for the HTML elements, including the grid layout, button styles, and overall presentation of the Todo-List interface.

JavaScript (script.js): Implements the functionality of the Todo-List, such as adding tasks to the list, displaying tasks dynamically, and allowing users to delete tasks individually.

Users can interact with the application by entering task names and due dates, which are then displayed in a grid layout. The "Add" button enables adding new tasks, and each task entry includes a "Delete" button to remove the respective task from the list.

To run the application, simply open the index.html file in any web browser to start managing your tasks efficiently.

This project serves as a fundamental example of creating a simple Todo-List using basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for task management.
